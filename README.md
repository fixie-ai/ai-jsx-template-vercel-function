# AI.JSX Hello World

This is a simple [AI.JSX](https://ai-jsx.com) project that demonstrates how to use the `ai-jsx`
package to create a simple AI-powered application.

This is meant to be as simple as possible, and as such the app here does not have any actual
UI â€“ it just writes its output (in the form of verbose logs) to the console.

## Building and running the app

1. Fork/clone this repo.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Set env var `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which you can obtain from the [OpenAI API dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) .
1. Run `npm start`.

You'll see output like:
```
Can one explore the vast history and culture of Ancient Egypt through books,
documentaries, and museum exhibits?
```
