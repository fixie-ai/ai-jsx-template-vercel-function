/**
  Originally, I had a file in api/handler.tsx. It compiled via `tsc` successfully. When I ran `vercel dev`, the program ran successfully. 
  However, Vercel also spat out a bunch of erroneous TS warnings. I think Vercel has a bug where it tries to compile
  using the wrong settings.

  To work around that, we emit a JS file, then run that via Vercel.
